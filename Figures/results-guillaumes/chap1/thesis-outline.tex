\section{Thesis outline} \label{sec:intro:outline}

This thesis describes the research work which resulted in the development and validation of several crucial pre-processing steps and ultimately a \ac{mpmri}-\ac{cad} system for the detection of \ac{cap}.
The different \ac{mpmri} modalities are presented in \textbf{\acs{chp}\,\ref{chap:2}}.
Latter towards the main objective of this thesis, an extensive study of the state-of-the-art on mono- and multi-parametric \ac{mri} \ac{cad} systems for \ac{cap} detection is presented in \textbf{\acs{chp}\,\ref{chap:3}}.
\textbf{\acl{chp}}~\ref{chap:4} presents the materials used and produced along by this thesis. 
\textbf{\acl{chp}}~\ref{chap:5} contains our first technical contribution regarding a crucial step of normalization for \ac{t2w}-\ac{mri} and \ac{dce}-\ac{mri} modalities.
\textbf{\acl{chp}}~\ref{chap:6} proposes a \ac{mpmri} \ac{cad} system along with extensive experiments and evaluations.
Finally, \textbf{\acs{chp}}\,\ref{chap:7} concludes the thesis and presents avenues for future research.
