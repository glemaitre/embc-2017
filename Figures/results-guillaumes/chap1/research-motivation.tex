\section{Research objectives}\label{sec:intro:motivation}

%As argue later in \acs{sec}\,\ref{subsec:chp3:dis:gen-dis},

From the previous section, it is obvious that \ac{cap}, as any type of cancers, is one of the major societal challenges in health care.
Until the causes of \ac{cap} are remaining unknown, screening with the use of \ac{cad} systems is the only solution.
Therefore, the main motivation of this thesis is to design and investigate a \ac{cad} system for the detection of \ac{cap}.
Furthermore, \ac{mri} has been shown to offer promising modalities for prostate screening.
Subsequently, the developed \ac{cad} system has to be based on \ac{mpmri} modalities.

To achieve this main objective, we propose to review the current state-of-the-art of the mono- and multi-parametric \ac{cad} systems.
From this review, the current scientific barriers will be identified and our proposed \ac{mpmri} \ac{cad} has addressed these drawbacks.
