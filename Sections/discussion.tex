\section{Conclusion}


In this paper, we presented one of the the first CAD system using  all the \ac{mpmri} modalities for prostate cancer detection.
 Indeed, \ac{mrsi} has nearly never been used together with the other modalities --- i.e., \ac{t2w}-\ac{mri}, \ac{dce}-\ac{mri}, and \ac{adc} map --- apart of the recent work of ~\cite{trigui2016classification,trigui2017automatic}. With an extensive validation approach  to select the best features, the best balancing strategy as well as the best classifier, we obtained results on a rather complicated dataset of 17 patients with an average AUC of 0.836 which put our system among the best, even so different CADs were tested on different datasets.
