\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we presented one of the the first \ac{cad} system using all
the \ac{mpmri} modalities for prostate cancer detection.
Indeed, \ac{mrsi} has nearly never been used together with the other
modalities.
With an extensive validation approach to select the best
features, the best balancing strategy as well as the best classifier,
we obtained results on a rather complicated dataset of 17 patients
with an average \ac{auc} of $0.836 \pm 0.083$ which put our system in the
state-of-the-art, even so different \ac{cad}s were tested on different
datasets.
