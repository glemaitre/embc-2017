\section{Conclusion} \label{sc:final-remarks}

The latest denoising techniques have been compared to the more conventional ones on a set of synthetic images onto which various noise types have been added as well as on \ac{sdoct} images.
In general \ac{bm3d}, \ac{pgpd}, and K-SVD led to the best results and should be regarded as the main techniques for denoising \ac{sdoct} images which inherently have speckle noise.
Future work will focus on recent techniques, BM4D~\cite{Maggioni} which benefits from the data structure (volume) of the \ac{sdoct} images as well as the recent work of Sheet~\emph{et~al.}~\cite{7163987} using deep learning to tackle the segmentation and the denoising in once.
Another interesting work will be to fully investigate, through classification performance, the effect of the selected noise removal techniques on a full pipeline of \ac{sdoct} volume for \ac{dme} classification~\cite{lemaitre2015classification}.
